Real Life Data Integration Using Python, Snowflake, SnowSQL, SQL & Power BI
📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence (DWBI) solution, built to demonstrate how real-life data flows from raw files to meaningful dashboards.

I designed, developed, and deployed the full pipeline — from data modeling to ETL with Python & SnowSQL, data warehousing in Snowflake, running SQL queries, and finally creating interactive reports in Power BI.

⚙️ Technologies Used

🐍 Python – Data generation, CSV handling, automation

❄️ Snowflake – Data warehouse for storing and managing data

💻 SnowSQL – Command-line client for Snowflake data loading

🗄️ SQL – Queries, transformations, and reporting logic

📊 Power BI – Dashboards & interactive data visualization

🔑 Key Features

✅ Data Modeling: Designed ER diagrams, star schema, and snowflake schema

✅ Test Data Generation: Automated with Python scripts

✅ Snowflake Setup: Databases, schemas, tables, and views created & configured

✅ Data Loading: Using both Python and SnowSQL for flexible ETL

✅ SQL Queries: Real-life scenario-based queries with WITH clauses and joins

✅ Power BI Dashboard: Clean, dynamic, and insightful visualizations
